# Collaborative Board - AI + Human Collaboration

A modern, interactive whiteboard application similar to Miro where AI agents (powered by Claude) and humans can collaborate using moveable sticky notes that can be grouped and organized by themes.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Infinite Canvas**: Pan and zoom with mouse controls
  - Click and drag to pan around the canvas
  - Scroll to zoom in/out
  - Reset view button to return to origin

### Sticky Notes
- **Create Notes**: Add sticky notes in 6 different colors (yellow, pink, blue, green, orange, purple)
- **Drag and Drop**: Move notes anywhere on the canvas
- **Edit Content**: Double-click any note to edit its content
- **Themes**: Organize notes by themes (General, Ideas, Todo, Important, Questions, or create custom themes)
- **Author Tracking**: Notes show whether they were created by a human or AI

### AI Collaboration with Claude
- **AI-Generated Notes**: Ask Claude to create notes based on prompts
  - Generate single or multiple notes at once (up to 10)
  - Context-aware: Claude considers existing notes on the board
- **Auto-Organize**: Let Claude analyze all notes and automatically group them by themes
- **Smart Grouping**: AI-powered theme detection and organization

### Grouping & Organization
- **Visual Groups**: Create colored groups to organize related notes
- **Drag Groups**: Move entire groups around the canvas
- **Theme-Based Organization**: Filter and organize by themes
- **Persistent Groups**: Groups maintain their note associations

### Data Persistence
- **Local Storage**: All notes, groups, and themes are automatically saved to browser storage
- **Auto-Save**: Changes are saved immediately

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Claude API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Installation

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd collab-board
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:5173`

### Configuring Claude API

1. Get your API key from [https://console.anthropic.com/](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. In the application, click the "Set API Key" button in the toolbar
3. Enter your API key and click "Save"

**Security Note**: This demo uses `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` for simplicity. In production, implement a backend proxy to protect your API key.

## Usage Guide

### Creating Notes

**Manual Notes**:
1. Select a color from the color palette
2. Choose a theme from the dropdown

4. Claude will create notes based on your prompt

### Moving Notes
- Click and drag any note to move it around the canvas
- Notes can be placed anywhere on the infinite canvas

### Creating Groups
